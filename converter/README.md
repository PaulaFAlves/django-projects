## Test Driven Development with Django

_Test Driven Development, or TDD, is a software development technique where tests are written first. 
That means the source code will be written afterwards, and all the logic will be build depending on the evolution of the tests._

_Django is a high-level Python Web framework._

This is a very simple application that convert measurements.
The point is to use TDD to develop it.
